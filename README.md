# hello-world
My first Git repository! (Hello-World)

This is just a temporary test repository to get used to GitHub. 
I'm hoping to reignite my development and scripting skills as well as contribute to projects, and understanding Git and GitHub is an important part of that.

My career interests are in moving to a DevOps Engineer or Test Engineer role. Automation and efficiency are what I strive for.
My personal tech interests are in Artificial Intelligence, its development, use cases, and its potential impact.
